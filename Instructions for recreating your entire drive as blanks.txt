Prerequisites:
A Text Editor (I personally use Notepad++)
Python 3.x (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
Make a folder that we'll use that contains your scripts & csv data. This forlder is referred to as "Blue Lagoon" below.

Preparation:
1. Download & Install WizTree: https://diskanalyzer.com/
2. Open it up and select the folder names you wish to backup, then select File > Export to .CSV File... and save this in Blue Lagoon.
NOTE: You can do this with as many CSV files as you like. It will just be more time consuming when it comes to restoring. So best to select main directories.
3. Open up your PowerWorking.py in a text editor, then change your "C:\Blue Lagoon\My Folders.csv" to suit your csv and filename.
4. Similarly, in the same .py file, change "C:\Blue Lagoon Processed" path to a folder you want to see your new blank files & folders in.
5. After you've done that, open CMD as admin, then locate to your folder that you have all these files in, and type into CMD (without quotes) "python PowerWorking.py"
6. Now you're done! You now have copies of your whole PCs file structure for exactly 0kbps!

Optional:
If you have more than one .csv, just keep updating and/or changing the paths to continuously reflect your data in different ways.
